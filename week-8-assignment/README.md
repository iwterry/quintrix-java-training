Week 8 assignment: Angular Hello World

How to run using npm:
If you do not have the Anglular CLI installed globally, run "npm install" from this directory to install it locally.
Go to the hello-world sub-directory and run "npm install" from that directory regardless of whether you have Angular CLI installed globally or locally.
Execute the command "npx ng serve" if Angular CLI is installed locally or the command "ng serve" if Angular CLI is installed globally in order run the application.
