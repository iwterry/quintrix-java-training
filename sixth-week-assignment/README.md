Sixth week's assignment
- Continuation of fifth week's assignment
  - Use Spring RestTemplate
    - Incorporate the use of path variables, query parameters, request body, and headers while using RestTemplate.
    - CommentController class will use RestTemplate (indirectly) for POST and GET requests to https://gorest.co.in/public/v2/comments and providing the data back to the client.
      - GET /api/v1/comments
        - NOTE: You search and get comments by using the "name" query parameter to filter comments that will match a comment's name field.
      - GET /api/v1/comments/{id}
      - POST /api/v1/comments
    - Integrate the use of a third-party REST API into the API from the fifth week.
      - PersonAndCommentController class will combine data from the previous week's API and the third-party API and send that to the client.
      - View combined data at GET /api/v1/people-and-comments.
    - NOTE: An access token is required to view any comments you made or to create any new comments. You can get an access token at https://gorest.co.in/.
      - The application looks for the token at src/main/resources/secret.properties file with the property name "gorest.api.access.token".
  - Use ControllerAdvice annotation and have central error handling
  - Use logging with SLF4J and LogBack
    - See src/main/resources/logback.xml file for details.
    - I am mainly using logging for CentralExceptionHandler class, but I did place a logging statement in CommentServiceImpl class to practice with having different logging levels for different packages.
