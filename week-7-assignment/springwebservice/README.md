Week 7 assignments: 
- develop a SOAP webservice client
  - I am making requests to the SOAP service at http://webservices.daehosting.com/services/isbnservice.wso
  - The following are good resources that I found useful:
    - https://spring.io/guides/gs/consuming-web-service/
    - https://www.baeldung.com/spring-soap-web-service
    - https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8854915/Szf26WHn
  - I created a REST API that makes a call to my SOAP webservice client to validate an ISBN-13 value.
  - The REST API has only one end point
    - POST /api/v1/isbn13-validation
      - sample request json:
        - { "isbn13Value": "978-0374275631" }
      - sample response json:
        - { "isValid" : true }
- perform unit testing using JUnit 5, Mockito, Hamcrest, etc.
  - I performed unit testing on the controller and service layers of the REST API.
